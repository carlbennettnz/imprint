While trying to build up my Chinese vocabulary, Iâ€™ve been finding that my retention of words that donâ€™t appear often is almost zero. This is my attempt to combat that, with a dictionary of words I _should_ know that regularly tests me to make sure I _do_ remember them with an exponential backoff as they're committed to memory.

Work in progress.

## Learn Chinese with flash cards

- [x] Learn from a looping, hardcoded dictionary of flash cards showing characters and pinyin
- [x] Select from multiple hardcoded lessons
- [x] Complete lessons by getting every item correct either first time or two times in a row
- [x] Receive feedback on your success, with your success rate determining which card youâ€™ll be shown next
- [ ] Have a global, editable dictionary that includes all lesson content, plus misc words
- [ ] Test yourself on content from multiple lessons at once
- [ ] Track successful completions, promoting words that need more revision
- [ ] Create and edit your own lessons
- [ ] Optionally hide the pinyin
- [ ] Invert the test, so you give the characters for a given English word or phrase
